## introduction about myself
My name is **Joud Al-Nsour**, a *23* years old, fresh **computer information system graduate finished in 3 years and half from middle east university  with a very good GPA (3.54)**. A former trainee at **KPMG company** for 3 months and I have an **IC3 course** certification.
## Article summary
 *These are typical phrases used to describe developer issues, in which problems begin small and unnoticed, grow in complexity, and eventually interrupt the entire project.* 

**So, if you wish to prevent these issues, these suggestions should be considered?**
1. *Determine your goal for the program:* At the end, what distinguishes a good programmer is the extent to which he is able to facilitate the use of the program, and what distinguishes a good program is the extent to which he is able to help people without complicating.

2. *The Goals of Software Design:*
Make your design simple and practical for yourself and easy to use for others at the end, it's not just about the program's functionality, but also about its capacity to be readily modified and developed by developers.
3. *(Mis)understanding:*
The developer's lack of understanding of their job causes them to become trapped in a vicious loop; nevertheless, your complete knowledge will help you avoid the misunderstanding difficulty.
4. *Simplicity:*
Simply, if developers are able to understand your software without facing difficulties or complications, you are a good developer, and if not, you are a bad developer.
5. *Complexity:*
Your focus on avoiding complexity instead of creating it is what will save you from falling into the cycle of errors in the program, by carefully considering any modifications you make to the program and the extent of their necessity without creating new loopholes, and this is all constrained by the main goal of your project from the first begging.
6. *Maintenance:*
As a developer, you have to take into consideration to think about maintenance. 
The rule to follow in this regard: Reducing maintenance effort is more important than reducing execution effort.

7. *Consistency:*
If you do something one way in one place, do it that way in every place. Code that isn't consistent becomes harder to understand. Don't keep forcing developers to relearn the way your system works every time they look at a new piece of it.
8. *Prioritizing:*
The changes that will bring you a lot of value and require little effort are better than those that will only bring you marginal improvements.

9. *Solving Problems:*

   By following three steps:
- Understand and define the problem
- Planning and processing information before taking any action
- try to deal with the big problem by dividing it into small problems and dealing with each one of them separately

10. *Good enough is fine:*
Developers tend to plan everything out in detail from the beginning. They don't focus on the problem they will solve and how their software will help people. Instead, start small, improve it, then extend - an incremental design is the best guide for software development.

11. *Predictions:*
Don't try to think about what would happened in the future. Just be as general and basic as you know you need to be now.

12. *Assumptions:*
In continuation to the previous point, do not assume that there is a problem and program your project based on it because the future holds unexpected problems. You will end up with codes that are difficult to decipher, and therefore you will have to rebuild your project from scratch.

13. *Stop Reinventing:*
Don't reinvent the wheel unless you need something that doesn't exist yet or no one thought about, or even if the existing "wheels" are bad technologies or incapable of handling your needs.

14. *Resistance:* Resist changes by reprioritizing your project.

15. *Automation:* If you can make things work automatically then stop doing them over and over again by yourself.

16. *Code measurement:* An Optimal code is a small set of code that is easy to understand and read.

17. *Productivity:* Your productivity depends on getting rid of codes, not writing them.

18. *Testing:* When you test your code, you should execute all newlines at least once and you should start testing parts before all, everyone should know that your code has been tested and working.

19. *(Under)Estimation:* Underestimating a small problem from the start is what will exacerbate it later, to avoid this, break each large part into small parts to reduce the margin of error if it is found in the end.

20. *Running Away from Rewriting:* Rewriting code is often a developer delusion, not the solution in most cases. There are many cases that you should consider to rewrite your code from scratch instated of avoiding it .

21. *Documentation and Commenting:* It is important to have documentation to explain your software's architecture and every module and components. This makes it easier for new developers to see the high-level picture of your software. don't forget that you explaining why it works like that instated of how, because it must be obvious when it comes to how.

22. *Picking Technologies (Tools, Libraries, etc.):* depending on external technologies can make everything even harder epically if they are buggy or not working properly. and there must be certain factors you should consider before start using them. Is it having active development?
Will it be maintained in the future?
How simple is it to get away from it?
What is the opinion of the community?
You can lessen the danger of selecting the incorrect technology if you can discover the proper answers to these questions.

23. *Self-Development:* Stay informed of most developments and be sure that every problem has a solution.

24. *Don’t be a hero:* Ask for help the time you realize you need it.

25. *Don’t Ask Questions… Ask for Help:* Do not ask others how to do something that is difficult for you to do, search it yourself and if you do not find the answer, don’t be shy to ask for help
